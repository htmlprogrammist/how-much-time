# How much time?
That is the question *everyone* asks. I've made the spreadsheet with my schedule to understand how much free time I have to spend it (or at least motivate myself) more productively.

The time is entered via ` - ` because for me it is visually more pleasant than through individual cells (I have already created this version of the table)

The program returns us the **number of hours**, even if it is minutes. That's what I need.

## Quickstart
In order for this program to work, you need to do this: 
- You can easily run the file `quickstart.py` (This file is given in the documentation of [Google Spreadsheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python)). 
- Then you need to enter the ID of your table in Google Sheets in the file `tokens.py`. 

To determine what your table ID is, just look at the link. For example: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UB1rF11HUTtIzRFbLOVEwBESmTSitlT_EGORvjHu54A/view`. 

In this case: `spreadsheet_id = '1UB1rF11HUTtIzRFbLOVEwBESmTSitlT_EGORvjHu54A'`

## For what needs?
This project will help me to remember how to cope with Google Spreadsheets API. It will also be used for my previous [project](https://github.com/htmlprogrammist/auto-sudoku)
